Steps to Fix and Run Python in x86_64 Mode
Install Rosetta 2 (if not already installed): Open Terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
Install an x86_64 Python Version: If you already have Homebrew installed:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install python@3.10
If you use a different version of Homebrew for x86_64:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install python@3.10
Run Python in x86_64 Mode: When running Python scripts, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/python3 <script_name>.py
Reinstall Numpy for x86_64: After ensuring you are using an x86_64 Python interpreter:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/pip3 install numpy
Verify Numpy and Python Architecture: Run the following commands to confirm the architecture:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/python3 -c "import platform; print(platform.architecture())"
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/python3 -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
Run Your Script in x86_64 Mode: Execute your Python script using:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/python3 /path/to/your_script.py
Modify Your Pygame Script
If you want to ensure Pygame uses the proper architecture, reinstall pygame in x86_64 mode:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/pip3 install pygame
Alternative Solution: Build a Virtual Environment
If switching between architectures is inconvenient, you can create an isolated Python environment specifically for x86_64:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/python3 -m venv x86_env
source x86_env/bin/activate
pip install numpy pygame
python your_script.py
Verifying the Architecture
To confirm that everything is working correctly:

bash
Copy code
arch -x86_64 python3 -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())"
This will output x86_64, confirming that Python and its libraries are running in the correct mode. Let me know if you encounter any issues during setup!
